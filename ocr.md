# Monlam OCR

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology allows knowledge frozen on paper to be transformed into digital texts that can be shared, edited, annotated, translated, and adapted into AI model. Past conservation efforts have resulted in scanning numerous texts in the Tibetan literary corpus. However, only a small percentage have been adapted into e-texts or digital text formats, as existing Tibetan OCR technology recognizes only computer-generated fonts and performs poorly on most woodblock prints and manuscripts. Monlam OCR will be able to handle most Tibetan scripts as well as woodblock prints and manuscripts.

**2023 deliverables**: We will prepare 400,000 lines of image-text pairs spanning 400 different writing styles. This training data will be used to train the first version of the Monlam OCR website.
