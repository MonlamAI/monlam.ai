# Monlam Translate

Machine Translation (MT) forms the backbone of numerous tools and technologies that provide people with equal access to information, knowledge, and communication. Currently, Tibetan language machine translation is unavailable on major translation services like Google Translate. And although some work on Tibetan-language MT has been done in China, religious and cultural content has largely been left out of it.

**2023 deliverables**: We, along with our partner organizations, will produce 4 million translated sentence pairs to train a literary Tibetan machine translation engine. This engine will power the first version of the Monlam Translate mobile app.
