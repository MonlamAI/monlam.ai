Monlam AI is a project of [Monlam IT](https://monlamit.com). It is an effort to develop Tibetan language technology in order to bridge the technology and language divides in the Tibetan communities. Over the next three years, this project will improve Tibetan AI in three major areas:
- [Machine Translation](mt.md)
- [OCR (Optical Character Recognition)](ocr.md)
- [Speech-to-Text + Text-to-Speech](stt.md)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) models “learn” from large amounts of high-quality **training data** prepared by humans. This project will focus on creating this training data for Tibetan language.
