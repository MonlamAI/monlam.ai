The Monlam AI project aims to improve Tibetan AI in three major areas:
- Machine Translation
- OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
- Speech-to-Text + Text-to-Speech

Artificial Intelligence (AI) models “learn” from large amounts of high-quality training data prepared by humans. This project will focus on creating this training data for Tibetan language.
 
## Monlam Translate

Machine Translation (MT) forms the backbone of numerous tools and technologies that provide people with equal access to information, knowledge, and communication. Currently, Tibetan language machine translation is unavailable on major translation services like Google Translate. And although some work on Tibetan-language MT has been done in China, religious and cultural content has largely been left out of it.

**2023 deliverables**: We, along with our partner organizations, will produce 4 million translated sentence pairs to train a literary Tibetan machine translation engine. This engine will power the first version of the Monlam Translate mobile app.
 
## Monlam OCR

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology allows knowledge frozen on paper to be transformed into digital texts that can be shared, edited, annotated, translated, and adapted into AI model. Past conservation efforts have resulted in scanning numerous texts in the Tibetan literary corpus. However, only a small percentage have been adapted into e-texts or digital text formats, as existing Tibetan OCR technology recognizes only computer-generated fonts and performs poorly on most woodblock prints and manuscripts. Monlam OCR will be able to handle most Tibetan scripts as well as woodblock prints and manuscripts.

**2023 deliverables**: We will prepare 400,000 lines of image-text pairs spanning 400 different writing styles. This training data will be used to train the first version of the Monlam OCR website.
 
## Monlam Speech

Speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech recognition are a cornerstone of modern technology to improve information sharing, communication channels, language learning and cross-dialect translation, and cultural promotion and exchange. Training a speech-to-text models requires 1,000 hours of training data. This data consists of 2- to 10-second audio segments with their exact transcription. The training data must be representative of how Tibetan use the language in their everyday lives. The same data can be used to train both speech-to-text and text-to-speech models.

**2023 deliverables**: We will prepare 1,000 hours of speech segments in order to train Central Tibetan speech-to-text and text-to-speech models. These models will be made available on the Monlam Speech website.

## Project Execution

The Monlam AI project will be implemented at the Monlam IT Research Center in Dharamsala and in the Monlam AI office at the Dalai Lama Institute Higher Education (DLIHE). The project will also involve contributions from freelancers from Sera, Jangchup Choling Nunnery, Pecha Jobs and other partner organizations.
