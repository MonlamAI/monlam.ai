## Monlam Speech

Speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech recognition are a cornerstone of modern technology to improve information sharing, communication channels, language learning and cross-dialect translation, and cultural promotion and exchange. Training a speech-to-text models requires 1,000 hours of training data. This data consists of 2- to 10-second audio segments with their exact transcription. The training data must be representative of how Tibetan use the language in their everyday lives. The same data can be used to train both speech-to-text and text-to-speech models.

**2023 deliverables**: We will prepare 1,000 hours of speech segments in order to train Central Tibetan speech-to-text and text-to-speech models. These models will be made available on the Monlam Speech website.
